## What is it?
CanUseTimer-Terminal is an open source writed in Python speedcubing
timer created to work in a terminal or command prompt window. Because 
this the program is soft and run anywhere, it means that can run in 
probally any computer with bad hardware and any operating system
(Windows, Linux and MacOS X). In future I will create a grafical
interface based in it, but I don't know a good grafical interface
Library or API to use in my project

## How it work?
First you need to install Python 3.8 or higher on your machine,
if you use Linux or MacOS not is required to install, if you don't
have in Windows you can install in the [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and download the [.zip file](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer-Terminal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
or clone repository. The program have an installer only for Linux, more installer will come soon

After install and open you need to press numbers and enter to do 
anything to program the numbers are:

1. Start the timer
1. Change modality
1. Credits
1. Exit program

### How to open in Windows?
For a while Windows not have an install version, to run you need to
have Python 3.8 or higher installed, is recommended you install
Python in windows store, after this you need to open the `Main.py`
file to start the program, else this will do nothing.
Later you need do open cmd and digit:

    pip install keyboard

and the program will start in a black window normaly.

### How to install in Linux?
You can install using the `install.sh` file. To start it you need to
open the terminal in the directory and digit:

    sudo ./install.sh

after this the program will install all the libraries needed and itself,
to start you can digit in your terminal:

    sudo canusetimer-terminal

You need to open with sudo because some libraries doesn't work without
super user (I don't know why this is happening but I will fix it soon).
