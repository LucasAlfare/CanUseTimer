- New modality added: pyranmix;
- Bug fixes and interface settings.

## How it work?
First you need to install Python 3.8 or higher on your machine,
if you use Linux or MacOS not is required to install, if you don't
have in Windows you can install in the [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the [.zip file](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer-Terminal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone repository.

After install and open you need to press numbers and enter to do 
anything to program the numbers are:

1. Start the timer
1. Change modality
1. Exit program

### How to open in Windows?
For a while Windows not have an install version, to run you need to
have Python 3.8 or higher installed, is recommended you install
Python in windows store, after this you need to open the `Main.py`
file to start the program, else this will do nothing.
Later you need do open cmd and digit:

    pip install keyboard

and the program will start in a black window normaly.

### How to install in Linux?
You can install using the `install.sh` file. To start it you need to
open the terminal in the directory and digit:

    sudo ./install

after this the program will install all the libraries needed, to start
you can digit in your terminal:

    sudo canusetimer

You need to open with sudo because some libraries doesn't work without
super user (I don't know why this is happening but I will fix it soon).

If you want to open with python (Not recommended if you are a casual
user) you need to check if you have python3.8 or higher installed in
your machine with `python3 --version` commmand, after this you need to
open the the terminal in directory and run:

    sudo python3 Main.py

You need to open with sudo because some libraries doesn't work without
super user (I don't know why this is happening but I will fix it soon).
