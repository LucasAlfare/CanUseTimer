## What is it?
CanUseTimer-Terminal is an open source wrote in Python speedcubing
timer created to work in a terminal or command prompt window. Due 
this the program is soft and run anywhere, it means that can run in 
probably any computer with bad hardware and any operating system
(Windows, Linux and Mac OS X). In the future, is planned to create a
graphical interface based in it, but we don't know a good graphical
interface Library to use in this project, but probably this will
take a long time.

## Can I help in project?
Yes, you can! I will verify your issue or pull request and if I like
the idea it will implement in my software. So don't be shy to share something good!

## Install
### Stable
The stable version is the most recommended to install in your machine
because there's fewer bugs, have installers for all systems, and you
don't need to know about programing and python to run it.

**Install**

Chose your Operating system:
|System|Latest version|File|
| :- | :- | :-: |
|Windows| 0.2.1 | [CanUseTimer-v0.2.1-Windows.zip](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer/releases/download/0.2.1/CanUseTimer-v0.2.1-Windows.zip) |

| Mac OS | - Comming soon ||

Old Versions [here.](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer/releases/)

### Unstable
The unstable version is a version that is in constant development,
and you can see new features constantly, but this version may come
with bugs of new implementations, recommended only if you want to
check what is coming and test it.

> :warning: This type of version only have Linux installer (Because
the creator use Linux).

**Install**

To get the unstable version you only need to clone this repository
with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer.git
cd CanUseTimer
```
after this you can run it with python or (if you use Linux) install
using the file `install.sh`. To update type `git pull` and install
it again.

**Run from source**

But if you don't want to install you can run directly from source
using Python. To do this process you need install python 3.7 or higher
with pip, after install you need to install the requirements using `pip
install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Then you can run with this command in your terminal:

	python Main.py

> :information_source: Use a Python virtual environment once the
unstable version can make conflicts with your python libraries. to
create one run `python -m venv env` in the project folder.
