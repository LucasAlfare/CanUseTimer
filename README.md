## What is it?
CanUseTimer is an open source writed in Python speedcubing timer
created to work in a terminal or command prompt window. Because 
this the program is soft and run anywhere, it means that can run
in probally any computer with bad hardware and any operational
system (Windows, Linux and MacOS X).

---
## How it work?
First you need to install Python 3.8 or higher on your machine,
if you use Linux or MacOS not is required to install, if you don't
have in Windows you can install in the [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the [.zip file](https://github.com/Samuel-de-Oliveira/CanUseTimer-Terminal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone repository.

After install and open you need to press numbers and enter to do 
anything to program the numbers are:

1. Start the timer
1. Change modality (Not working yet)
1. Exit program

### How to open in Windows?
For a while Windows not have an install version, to run you need to
have Python 3.8 or higher installed, is recommended you install in
windows store, after this you need to open the `Main.py` file to
start the program, else this will do nothing.
Later you need do open cmd and digit:

    pip install keyboard

and the program will start in a black window normaly.

### How to open in Linux?
For a while Linux not have an install version, to run you need to have
Python 3.8 or higher installed, after this you need to open your terminal
emulator in folder and run the command:

    sudo python3 Main.py

You need to open with sudo because some libraries doesn't work without super user (I don't know why this is happening but I will fix it soon).
