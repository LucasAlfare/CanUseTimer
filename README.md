## What is it?
CanUseTimer-Terminal is an open source writed in Python speedcubing
timer created to work in a terminal or command prompt window. Because 
this the program is soft and run anywhere, it means that can run in 
probally any computer with bad hardware and any operating system
(Windows, Linux and MacOS X). In future I will create a grafical
interface based in it, but I don't know a good grafical interface
Library to use in my project, but probally this will take a long
time.
